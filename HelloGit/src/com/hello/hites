Utilizes GitHub Actions to automate code quality checks as part of the development workflow.
Key Checks Included:

Code Formatting: Ensures consistent code formatting using tools like Prettier, Black, or ESLint.
Linting: Identifies syntax errors, potential bugs, and style issues in the codebase using linters like ESLint, pylint, or RuboCop.
Static Code Analysis: Analyzes code for potential security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and other code smells using tools like SonarQube or CodeClimate.
Benefits:

Consistency: Enforces consistent coding standards and practices across the project, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
Early Bug Detection: Identifies issues early in the development process, reducing the likelihood of bugs reaching production.
Improved Codebase: Helps maintain a high-quality codebase by addressing code quality issues promptly.

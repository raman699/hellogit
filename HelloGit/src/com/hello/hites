Cost Savings:

Automating repetitive tasks with GitHub Actions can lead to significant cost savings by reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.
Cost savings can be calculated based on the time saved by developers and the associated labor costs.
Hours Saved:

GitHub Actions can save hours of manual work by automating tasks such as testing, code quality checks, deployment, and more.
The exact hours saved will depend on the frequency of automation and the complexity of workflows.
Example Calculation:

Let's consider a scenario where a team spends 2 hours per day manually running tests, code quality checks, and deployment tasks.
With GitHub Actions, these tasks can be automated, saving 2 hours per day per developer.
For a team of 5 developers, this amounts to 10 hours saved per day.
Over a month (assuming 20 working days), this results in 200 hours saved.
If the average developer cost is $50 per hour, the monthly cost savings would be $10,000.
Benefits Beyond Cost:

In addition to cost savings, GitHub Actions also bring intangible benefits such as improved code quality, faster time-to-market, and increased developer satisfaction.
Conclusion:

GitHub Actions not only save time and money but also contribute to a more efficient and productive development process, ultimately leading to better outcomes for the team and the organization.
